<h1>Buggy : V.2.0</h1>

A batch-testing sublime plug-in for CodeForces
<br><br>
This application is to assist a competitive-programmer in a CodeForces round. This application downloads all the sample test cases for a problem and runs a user&#39;s solution program on all these test cases so that no time is wasted on manual checking of the solution.

For now the application is for C++ users only.
<br>
<br>
<b>The project is under constant development and the files in the repository might be unstable. It is therefore advised to download the latest release for usage. <a href="https://github.com/pakhandi/Buggy---Linux/archive/V.2.0.zip">This is the link</a> to the latest release</b>
<br>

<h3>Requisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>Internet Connection (it should be working on terminal)</li>
<li>Sublime Text-3 or Sublime Text-2
	<ul>
	<li>To check Sublime is installed correctly
		<ol>
		<li>Open a <b>terminal</b> window.</li>
		<li>Run "subl".</li>
		<li>If Sublime opens up, everything is perfect.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>A default browser</li>
<li>Working g++
	<ul>
	<li>To check g++ is working
		<ol>
		<li>Open a <b>terminal</b> window.</li>
		<li>Run "g++".</li>
		<li>If it identifies the command, everything is perfect.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download all the files from <a href="https://github.com/pakhandi/Buggy---Linux/archive/V.2.0.zip">here : V.2.0</a>.</li>
<li>Open Sublime, and change your build system
	<ol>
	<li>GoTo <b>"Tools -> Build System -> New Build System".</b></li>
	<li>A file with some pre-written code will open-up, delete all the contents of this file.</li>
	<li>In the <b>src_linux</b> folder you&#39;ll find a file <b>CF.sublime-build</b>. Copy the contents of this file in the file that had opened up in the previous step.</li>
	<li>Save this file in the default location with name <b>CF</b>.</li>
	<li>GoTo <b>"Tools -> Build System"</b> and select <b>CF</b> </li>
	<li>Your Sublime is now configured</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li>Change the template code in <b>template.cpp</b> as it suits you. (Let the end-comment be there to show support :) ).</li>
</ol>


<h3>Technology Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>The application is made using Python-2.7.9 and Shell scripting</li>
<li><b>BeautifulSoup</b> module is used alongwith <b>requests</b> in Python</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing</h3>
The program has been tested on Ubuntu14.04, 64-bit

<h3>Usage</h3>
Open a terminal and move to <b>dist</b> folder and run <b>sh start.sh</b>. Then you&#39;ll need to enter the CodeForces round number (the one you see in the URL).<br>
It'll then download everything and open Sublime and the problemset in our default browser.<br>
Code your solution and press <b>Ctrl+B</b> to compile the code.<br>
Use <b>Ctrl+Shift+B</b> to run the program on the test files.<br>

<h3>Understanding Source Files</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h6>start.sh</h6>
It is the shell file which drives the entire application. It first takes the round number as the input and passes it to the <b>ini</b>. After <b>ini</b> has completed it&#39;s task, <b>start.sh</b> opens the contest-folder in Sublime, and opens the template for the first problem, after that it opens the Problems-Webpage in the default browser and ends.
</li>
<li>
<h6>ini</h6>
<b>ini</b> is the executable format of the python script <b>ini.py</b>. The python script <b>ini.py</b> uses <i>requests</i> and <i>BeautifulSoup</i> to fetch the data from the CodeForces site. The driver shell file, <b>start.sh</b>, passes the round number to the python script so that the script fetches the problems of the required round. <b>ini</b> also makes the folders, according to the question numbers, and puts the test-cases as well as the template code into them. Another shell file, <b>f.sh</b> is also transferred to all the folders.
</li>
<li>
<h6>f.sh</h6>
This shell file holds the responsibility to run the .exe file generated by the program of the user on all the test-files and show the output generated by the user's program and the correct output.
</li>
<li>
<h6>template.cpp</h6>
This file is to allow user to set a template code for his solutions. This code will be transferred to each problem-folder as <b>prog.cpp</b>
</li>
<li>
<h6>CF.sublime-build</h6>
This is the sublime-build file. This is a custom build which compiles cpp code and makes an exe file on <b>Ctrl+B</b>, and runs the <b>f.sh</b> file on <b>Ctrl+Shift+B</b>.
</li>
</ul>
